Thank you for your interest in contributing to PixelTwin Website Cloner! This document provides guidelines for contributing to the project.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Python 3.13+** for the backend
- **Node.js 18+** for the frontend
- **Git** for version control
- At least one LLM API key (OpenAI, Anthropic, or Google Gemini)

### Development Setup

1. **Fork and clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/PixelTwinWebCloner.git
   cd PixelTwinWebCloner
   ```

2. **Backend setup:**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   python -m venv .venv
   .venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
   # source .venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
   uv pip install --requirements requirements.txt
   playwright install
   ```

3. **Frontend setup:**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```

4. **Environment configuration:**
   - Copy `backend/.env.example` to `backend/.env`
   - Add your LLM API keys

## Development Guidelines

### Code Style
- **Python**: Follow PEP 8 guidelines
- **TypeScript/React**: Follow standard ESLint rules
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add comments for complex logic
- Write docstrings for Python functions

### Security Considerations
- **Never commit API keys or sensitive data**
- Always use environment variables for configuration
- Review the `.gitignore` before committing
- Sanitize user input in both frontend and backend

### Testing
- Test your changes with multiple website types
- Verify both static and JavaScript-heavy sites work
- Test all three LLM providers if possible
- Check both successful clones and error cases
